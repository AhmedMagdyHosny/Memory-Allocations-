# Memory-Allocations-
This project is simulating how processes are allocated in memory using best fit way and first fit and shows the deallocation of the processes from the memory as well .

Some important notes :
1) The project is developed in C#.
2) To allocate using best fit write in way of allocation
--- B.F.
3) To allocate using first fit write in way of allocation
--- F.F.
4) You have to initialize first the memory by pressing
the initialize button .
5) To press a button you have to enter all the values
inside the text box beside it and the press the
button
6) The aqua color means that this is a free space
written on it the value of the free space
7) The brown color means that a process has taken
this free space in memory and written on it the
name of the process
8) If you entered the same process more that one
time to allocate space and you want to deallocate
it you have to press deallocate button twice a
time to deallocate this same process from all over
the memory
